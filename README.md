# Doubly_linked_list
It is a Data Structure having the nodes and each nodes are connected via link{node Contain: 1)Data part,2)link(which is pointer to the next node)2.a)link to next node. 2.b).link to previous node.
Our program is doing all the doubly linked list operation such as insert at {beggining,End,Middle},Delete at{beggining,End,Middle} and show function which will show the currently present nodes in the doubly_linked_list.As the doubly linked list contain two pointer,here we denoted them by using prev,and next pointer.
Also the output of the program is menu driven hence we can easily check the program working if we have knowlege of doubly linked list.

# Priority_queue
Implementation of priority queue:
where Priority_queue will work as traditional queue were working along with it has a priority of each value which has inserted accordingly the queue elements are processed depending upon their priority.


# Singly_linked_list
linked list is the set of nodes which are connecting to each other via link.link list contain nodes,where each node has two components data and pointer to next node.
Although the data might be absent but pointer to next node(i.e link) must be there,also this list contain header pointing to first node of the list.
In this we perfrom various operation like insertion at {beginning,end},delettion at {beginnig,middle,end}, and contain the display()  function to show the content of each operation. Although the output is menu driven so you need to thorough knowlege of linked_list.
